This is a simple python script which install Notepad++ on Debian/Ubuntu (or any other distro that uses apt-get.)

This project is not associated with the Notepad++ team.

UPDATE: 5/6/09: I am planning to update the project soon with the latest versions of Ubuntu, Wine and NPP.

Stay tuned and thanks to all that use this npp-installer!
